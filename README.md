# Landing page of food website


**Food Website:**
This project is a food website that aims to promote healthy eating and encourage users to order nutritious meals. The website showcases a visually appealing design and provides easy navigation through various sections. Users can explore the home page, place food orders, read testimonials, and find contact information.

2.HTML and CSS Code

**Usage:**

Once the food website is running in your web browser, you can navigate through its sections using the menu bar. Here's a brief overview of each section:

1.Home: Provides an introduction to the website and showcases an animated plate with a food image. The text section encourages users to stay fit and eat healthy, with an option to order food.

2.Order: Allows users to place their food orders. Further implementation details can be added if applicable.

3.Testimonials: Displays testimonials from satisfied customers who have enjoyed the food from the website. Add real or fictional testimonials to showcase the positive experiences.

4.Contact: Provides contact information for users to reach out with inquiries or feedback.

**HTML and CSS Code:**

The project's code consists of an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (text.css). The HTML file contains the structure of the website, including the navigation bar, sections, and content. The CSS file (text.css) defines the styling and layout of the website components.

The CSS code separates the website into three sections: a green-themed left section (first), a dark gray middle section (second), and a vibrant green right section (third). The navigation bar (nav) is positioned at the top, displaying the logo and menu options. The animated plate with a food image is positioned on the right side, accompanied by a text section with headings and a call-to-action button.
